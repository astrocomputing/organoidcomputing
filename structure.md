# ORGANOID COMPUTING

**Premise:** This book explores the theoretical foundations and computational modeling of using three-dimensional brain organoids as a novel computational substrate ("wetware"). We investigate how the neurobiological principles governing organoid development and function can be harnessed or simulated to perform information processing. Each chapter integrates discussion of relevant biological and computational concepts with hands-on Python implementations using the Brian2 neural simulator. The focus is on building and analyzing *organoid-inspired* models to explore computational primitives (such as signal processing, basic logic, memory, and pattern recognition), advancing towards more complex biological considerations and future paradigms.

**Target Audience:** Advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers in neuroscience, bioengineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and related disciplines interested in the theoretical foundations and computational modeling of brain organoids specifically for computational purposes, leveraging the Brian2 simulator. Prior knowledge of neuroscience fundamentals and basic Python programming is expected. Familiarity with the basics of neural simulation with Brian2 will be beneficial but not strictly required, as introductory aspects of the library will be covered.
