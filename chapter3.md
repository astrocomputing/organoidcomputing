----

*This chapter marks a crucial transition from the biological substrate detailed in Chapter 2 towards the principles and tools required for computational modeling, specifically within the context of Organoid Computing. We lay the essential groundwork of computational neuroscience, establishing the framework for understanding how neural elements process information. We begin by discussing the various levels of abstraction at which neural systems can be modeled, framing the individual neuron as a fundamental computational unit. The chapter then introduces key mathematical models used to describe the electrical behavior of single neurons, starting with a conceptual overview of the biophysically detailed Hodgkin-Huxley model and then delving into mathematically simpler yet powerful abstractions, with a particular focus on the widely used Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. We will also briefly introduce other influential models like the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF), Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF), Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx), and Izhikevich models, highlighting their respective strengths and suitability for different modeling goals. Following the discussion of single neuron dynamics, we will cover the basics of synaptic transmission, the mechanism by which neurons communicate, explaining excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs) and contrasting current-based versus conductance-based synaptic models. We will also explore fundamental concepts in neural coding, examining how information might be represented or encoded in the patterns of neuronal firing, including rate codes, temporal codes, and population codes. Critically, this chapter introduces the first practical, hands-on simulation example using the Brian2 simulator. We will demonstrate how to implement and simulate a single LIF neuron in Brian2, introducing core concepts like defining model equations, creating neuron groups, running simulations, and monitoring neuron states and spikes, thereby providing the foundational skills needed for the more complex network simulations presented in subsequent chapters.*

**3.1 Levels of Modeling. The Neuron as a Computational Unit**

Understanding the brain, or even the simplified neural networks within a brain organoid, is a task of immense complexity, spanning vast scales of space and time. Computational neuroscience attempts to tackle this complexity by developing mathematical and computational models that capture essential aspects of neural function at different **levels of abstraction**. Choosing the appropriate level depends critically on the specific scientific question being asked. At the most detailed level, **molecular modeling** focuses on the behavior of individual molecules, such as the conformational changes of ion channel proteins, the kinetics of neurotransmitter binding to receptors, or the intricate biochemical cascades within intracellular signaling pathways. This level provides ultimate biophysical grounding but is computationally prohibitive for simulating even small networks. Moving up a level, **cellular modeling** focuses on the behavior of a single neuron (or glial cell). This often involves integrating the effects of numerous ion channels distributed across the neuron's membrane, possibly including detailed reconstructions of its dendritic morphology (multi-compartment models), or using simplified point-neuron models that capture the essential input-output function of the cell. This is the primary level of focus for much of this chapter. Ascending further, **network modeling** (or microcircuit modeling) examines the collective dynamics and computational properties emerging from the interactions of multiple, synaptically connected neurons, often organized into specific circuit motifs. This is the level where phenomena like oscillations, synchrony, and basic information processing operations become apparent, and it will be the focus of much of the rest of the book. Finally, **systems-level modeling** aims to understand the function of large brain areas or the interactions between multiple brain regions to explain complex cognitive functions or behaviors, often using more abstract representations of neural populations and information flow.

`[Conceptual Figure 3.1: Levels of Modeling in Neuroscience. A hierarchical diagram showing different levels: Bottom level - Molecular (ion channel, receptor). Second level - Cellular (single neuron morphology, spiking activity). Third level - Network/Microcircuit (interconnected neurons, local field potential). Top level - Systems (interacting brain regions, behavior/cognition). Arrows indicate increasing scale and abstraction upwards.]`

Within this hierarchy, the **single neuron** is often considered the fundamental **computational unit** of the nervous system. This perspective, while a simplification (as computation also occurs at sub-cellular and network levels), provides a powerful conceptual starting point. Neurons receive inputs from potentially thousands of other neurons via synapses impinging primarily on their dendrites and soma (cell body). These inputs, in the form of postsynaptic potentials, are integrated spatially and temporally by the neuron. If the resulting depolarization of the neuron's membrane potential at a critical region (typically the axon hillock or axon initial segment) reaches a specific **threshold**, the neuron fires an **action potential** (or "spike")—a stereotyped, all-or-none electrical pulse. This action potential then propagates down the neuron's axon, potentially branching to transmit signals to numerous downstream target neurons via synapses. In this view, the neuron acts as a complex, non-linear processing device: it integrates myriad inputs, applies a threshold non-linearity, and generates a digital-like output signal (the spike) that serves as the input for other neurons. Understanding the mathematical rules governing this input-output transformation—how a neuron translates its synaptic inputs into a pattern of output spikes—is therefore a cornerstone of computational neuroscience and essential for building models of neural networks, including those inspired by brain organoids. The specific mathematical model chosen to represent this transformation depends on the desired balance between biological realism and computational tractability.

**3.2 Biophysical Models (Hodgkin-Huxley - Overview)**

The quest for quantitatively understanding the neuron's electrical behavior reached a monumental milestone with the work of Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in the early 1950s. Through meticulous voltage-clamp experiments on the squid giant axon, they developed a detailed mathematical model—now known as the **Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model**—that accurately described the ionic mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of the action potential. This Nobel Prize-winning work laid the foundation for biophysically realistic neuronal modeling. The HH model conceptualizes the neuron's membrane as an electrical circuit containing a capacitor ($C_m$, representing the lipid bilayer's ability to store charge) in parallel with several variable conductances ($g_{\text{ion}}$), each representing a specific type of voltage-gated ion channel permeable to particular ions (primarily sodium ($Na^+$), potassium ($K^+$), and sometimes chloride ($Cl^-$) or calcium ($Ca^{2+}$)). Each conductance is associated with a **reversal potential** ($E_{\text{ion}}$), the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of that specific ion, determined by the Nernst equation based on intra- and extracellular ion concentrations. The flow of ions through these channels generates ionic currents ($I_{\text{ion}}$) according to Ohm's law: $I_{\text{ion}} = g_{\text{ion}} (V_m - E_{\text{ion}})$, where $V_m$ is the membrane potential.

The crucial innovation of the HH model lies in describing how the conductances ($g_{\text{ion}}$) change dynamically as a function of membrane voltage and time. They proposed that each channel type possesses hypothetical "gating particles" that control whether the channel is open or closed. For instance, the voltage-gated sodium channel was modeled with three activation gates ('m' gates) that open rapidly upon depolarization and one inactivation gate ('h' gate) that closes more slowly upon sustained depolarization. The voltage-gated potassium channel was modeled with four activation gates ('n' gates) that open more slowly upon depolarization. The probability of each gate being in the permissive state (e.g., $m$, $h$, $n$ representing the probabilities for the respective gates) is governed by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose rate constants are voltage-dependent, empirically determined functions fitted to the experimental data. The total conductance for an ion species is then proportional to the product of the probabilities of its gates being in the open configuration (e.g., $g_{\text{Na}} = \bar{g}_{\text{Na}} m^3 h$ and $g_{\text{K}} = \bar{g}_{\text{K}} n^4$, where $\bar{g}$ represents the maximum possible conductance). The rate of change of the membrane potential ($dV_m/dt$) is then determined by the sum of all currents flowing across the membrane (capacitive current, ionic currents, leakage current, and any externally applied current $I_{\text{ext}}$), according to Kirchhoff's current law applied to the membrane capacitance:

```latex
\begin{align*}
 C_m \frac{dV_m}{dt} &= I_{\text{ext}} - I_{\text{Na}} - I_{\text{K}} - I_{\text{Leak}} \\
 I_{\text{Na}} &= \bar{g}_{\text{Na}} m^3 h (V_m - E_{\text{Na}}) \\
 I_{\text{K}} &= \bar{g}_{\text{K}} n^4 (V_m - E_{\text{K}}) \\
 I_{\text{Leak}} &= g_{\text{Leak}} (V_m - E_{\text{Leak}})
 \tag{3.1}
 \end{align*}
 ```

The dynamics of the gating variables $m$, $h$, and $n$ are described by additional coupled ODEs of the form: $\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha_x(V_m) (1 - x) - \beta_x(V_m) x$, where $x \in \{m, h, n\}$, and $\alpha_x$ and $\beta_x$ are voltage-dependent rate functions determined experimentally.

`[Conceptual Figure 3.2: Hodgkin-Huxley Membrane Circuit Diagram. An electrical circuit diagram representing the neuron membrane. Shows a capacitor (Cm) in parallel with variable resistors/conductances representing Na+ channels (g_Na), K+ channels (g_K), and a Leak conductance (g_Leak). Each conductance path includes a battery representing the respective reversal potential (E_Na, E_K, E_Leak). An external current source (I_ext) is also shown.]`

The HH model was remarkably successful in quantitatively reproducing the shape and threshold behavior of the action potential, refractoriness (the brief period after a spike when it's harder or impossible to fire another), and other electrical properties of the squid giant axon. Its principles have been extended to model neurons from many different species and brain regions by incorporating additional types of ion channels (e.g., various calcium channels, different potassium channel subtypes like A-type or M-type channels) identified through subsequent experimental work. These detailed **biophysical models** offer the highest degree of biological realism, allowing researchers to investigate the specific contributions of particular ion channels or molecular mechanisms to neuronal function. However, this realism comes at a significant **computational cost**. Simulating HH-type models involves solving a system of several coupled, non-linear ODEs per neuron, which can become computationally prohibitive when simulating large networks containing thousands or millions of neurons, especially for long simulation durations. Furthermore, accurately parameterizing these models requires extensive electrophysiological data that may not always be available, particularly for the diverse and potentially immature cell types found in brain organoids. Therefore, while invaluable for understanding fundamental mechanisms, highly detailed biophysical models are often impractical for large-scale network simulations aimed at understanding emergent computational properties. This motivates the development and use of mathematically simpler neuron models.

**3.3 Simplified Models: LIF (Detailed), QIF, EIF, AdEx, Izhikevich (Overview & Suitability)**

Recognizing the computational demands and parameterization challenges associated with detailed biophysical models like Hodgkin-Huxley, computational neuroscientists have developed a range of **simplified neuron models**. These models aim to capture the essential input-output behavior of neurons—primarily their ability to integrate inputs and fire action potentials when a threshold is reached—while abstracting away much of the underlying biophysical detail of specific ion channels. This simplification dramatically reduces the computational cost, making it feasible to simulate very large networks, while often still providing valuable insights into network dynamics and computation. The choice of which simplified model to use involves a trade-off between computational efficiency and the richness of the neuronal dynamics captured.

The most widely used and arguably simplest spiking neuron model is the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model**. The LIF neuron is represented by a single linear ordinary differential equation describing the dynamics of its membrane potential ($V$). It models the neuron as a simple RC circuit, where the membrane acts as a capacitor ($C$) being charged by input currents ($I(t)$) and constantly "leaking" charge through a fixed membrane resistance ($R$). The subthreshold dynamics are governed by:

```latex
 \tau \frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_{\text{rest}}) + R I(t)
 \tag{3.2}
 ```

Here, $\tau = RC$ is the **membrane time constant**, which determines how quickly the membrane potential changes in response to input currents, $V_{\text{rest}}$ is the resting membrane potential (the potential in the absence of input), and $I(t)$ represents the total input current (sum of synaptic currents and any external applied current). The model integrates the input current $I(t)$ over time. If the membrane potential $V$ reaches a predefined **threshold value** ($V_{\text{thresh}}$), the neuron is said to fire an action potential (a "spike"). Immediately after firing, two events occur: 1) the membrane potential is instantaneously reset to a **reset potential** ($V_{\text{reset}}$, typically below or equal to $V_{\text{rest}}$), and 2) the neuron enters an optional **absolute refractory period** ($t_{\text{ref}}$), during which it cannot fire another spike, regardless of the input. This simple mechanism captures the core features of neuronal integration, thresholding, and refractoriness with just one differential equation, making it extremely computationally efficient.

`[Conceptual Figure 3.3: LIF Neuron Dynamics. Panel (a): RC circuit diagram for LIF (Resistor R and Capacitor C in parallel, driven by current I(t)). Panel (b): Graph showing membrane potential V(t) over time. Input current I(t) steps up. V(t) rises exponentially towards a steady state determined by I(t). When V(t) crosses V_thresh, a spike is emitted (often just marked as a vertical line), V(t) is immediately reset to V_reset, and then integration resumes. An optional refractory period t_ref is shown after the reset.]`

While computationally efficient, the standard LIF model has limitations. It lacks the detailed spike initiation dynamics seen in real neurons (the onset of the spike is abrupt rather than smooth) and cannot intrinsically generate more complex firing patterns like bursting or spike frequency adaptation. Several other simplified models have been developed to address these shortcomings while maintaining relatively low computational cost. The **Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF)** model introduces a quadratic term ($V^2$) into the voltage equation, resulting in a finite-time singularity (voltage diverges to infinity) when threshold is reached, providing a slightly more realistic spike initiation dynamic. The **Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (EIF)** model incorporates an exponential term that becomes dominant near the threshold, providing an even better approximation of the sharp spike upswing observed experimentally. A common form of the EIF equation is $\tau \frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_{\text{rest}}) + \Delta_T \exp\left(\frac{V - V_T}{\Delta_T}\right) + RI(t)$. Here $V_T$ represents an effective threshold potential and $\Delta_T$ is a slope factor determining the sharpness of the spike initiation.

To capture phenomena like spike frequency adaptation (where firing rate decreases during sustained stimulation) or bursting (firing clusters of spikes), models incorporating additional dynamic variables have been developed. The **Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) model** extends the EIF model by adding a second variable, $w$, representing an adaptation current (often modeling slow potassium currents or calcium-dependent currents). This variable $w$ increases with each spike and decays slowly, providing a negative feedback that reduces excitability after firing, leading to adaptation. By adjusting parameters, the AdEx model can reproduce a wide range of firing patterns observed in cortical neurons (e.g., regular spiking, adapting, bursting, initial burst) with only two variables. The **Izhikevich model** (developed by Eugene Izhikevich) is another popular two-variable model ($V$ and an adaptation/recovery variable $u$) that uses a clever combination of quadratic dynamics for $V$ and a piecewise linear dynamics for $u$, along with a non-linear reset mechanism. By varying just four parameters ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$), the Izhikevich model can efficiently reproduce an astonishing variety of known neuronal firing patterns (including intrinsically bursting, chattering, fast spiking, low-threshold spiking, etc.), making it a powerful tool for simulating heterogeneous networks with diverse neuronal behaviors at a relatively low computational cost compared to full HH models.

The choice of which model to use depends on the specific research question and computational resources. For very large network simulations where capturing the precise details of spike shape or adaptation is less critical than simulating overall network activity and interactions, the **LIF model** often provides the best balance of simplicity and utility. If spike initiation dynamics are important, **EIF or QIF** might be preferred. If capturing adaptation or bursting behavior is crucial for the phenomenon under study (e.g., modeling certain types of oscillations or network state transitions), **AdEx or Izhikevich models** offer significant advantages over LIF, providing richer dynamics with only a moderate increase in computational cost. Throughout this book, while we will primarily focus on the LIF model for its simplicity in introducing core concepts, we will also revisit and implement some of these more complex models (especially in Chapter 11) when discussing more advanced topics where their richer dynamics become relevant for modeling organoid-like activity.

**3.4 Basic Synaptic Transmission (EPSPs, IPSPs, Current vs. Conductance Models)**

Neurons communicate with each other primarily through specialized junctions called **synapses**. When an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal of an axon, it typically triggers the release of chemical messengers called **neurotransmitters** into the synaptic cleft, the narrow gap separating the presynaptic neuron from the postsynaptic neuron. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the cleft and bind to specific **receptor proteins** embedded in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron. This binding event initiates a sequence of changes in the postsynaptic neuron, ultimately altering its membrane potential and influencing its likelihood of firing an action potential. The precise effect depends crucially on the type of neurotransmitter released and the type of receptors present on the postsynaptic membrane.

The most common neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is **glutamate**, which typically mediates **excitatory** neurotransmission. When glutamate binds to its receptors (e.g., AMPA or NMDA receptors) on the postsynaptic neuron, it usually leads to the opening of ion channels permeable primarily to positive ions like sodium ($Na^+$) and sometimes calcium ($Ca^{2+}$). The resulting influx of positive charge causes a transient depolarization (making the membrane potential less negative) of the postsynaptic membrane. This transient depolarization is called an **Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)**. If enough EPSPs arrive close together in time and space (temporal and spatial summation), they can collectively depolarize the neuron sufficiently to reach its firing threshold, triggering an action potential. Conversely, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is **gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)**. When GABA binds to its receptors (e.g., GABA$_A$ or GABA$_B$ receptors), it typically leads to the opening of channels permeable to negatively charged chloride ions ($Cl^-$) or sometimes potassium ions ($K^+$). The influx of $Cl^-$ or efflux of $K^+$ generally makes the membrane potential more negative (hyperpolarization) or stabilizes it near the resting potential (shunting inhibition), making it harder for the neuron to reach threshold in response to excitatory inputs. This transient hyperpolarization or stabilization is called an **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)**. The balance between incoming EPSPs and IPSPs determines the net drive on the postsynaptic neuron and ultimately dictates its firing output.

`[Conceptual Figure 3.4: EPSP and IPSP. Panel (a): Schematic of an excitatory synapse releasing glutamate, leading to Na+ influx and an EPSP (depolarizing voltage trace) in the postsynaptic neuron. Panel (b): Schematic of an inhibitory synapse releasing GABA, leading to Cl- influx (or K+ efflux) and an IPSP (hyperpolarizing or shunting voltage trace) in the postsynaptic neuron.]`

In computational modeling, synaptic transmission needs to be represented mathematically. Two common approaches exist for modeling the effect of synaptic input on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential: **current-based models** and **conductance-based models**. The simpler approach is the **current-based synapse model**. Here, the arrival of a presynaptic spike is assumed to instantaneously inject a fixed amount of current, or more realistically, trigger a transient current pulse ($I_{\text{syn}}(t)$) with a specific time course (e.g., an exponential decay or an alpha function shape, like $t \exp(-t/\tau_{\text{syn}})$), into the postsynaptic neuron. This synaptic current $I_{\text{syn}}(t)$ is then simply added to the total input current $I(t)$ in the neuron's membrane equation (like Equation 3.2 for the LIF model). For an excitatory synapse, $I_{\text{syn}}$ would be positive (depolarizing), and for an inhibitory synapse, it would be negative (hyperpolarizing). This model is computationally very efficient as it only involves adding a term to the voltage equation. However, it lacks biological realism because the actual effect of opening synaptic channels depends not only on the number of open channels but also on the **driving force**, which is the difference between the current membrane potential ($V$) and the **reversal potential** ($E_{\text{rev}$) for the ions permeable through those channels. The reversal potential is the potential at which the net flow of ions through the open channel is zero. For typical excitatory synapses permeable to Na+ and K+, $E_{\text{rev}}$ is usually around 0 mV. For inhibitory synapses permeable to Cl- or K+, $E_{\text{rev}}$ is typically near or below the resting potential (e.g., -70 mV or -80 mV).

**Conductance-based synapse models** explicitly account for this driving force. Instead of injecting a current, the arrival of a presynaptic spike triggers a transient increase in the postsynaptic membrane's **conductance** ($g_{\text{syn}}(t)$) to specific ions. The resulting synaptic current is then calculated according to Ohm's law, incorporating the driving force:

```latex
 I_{\text{syn}}(t) = g_{\text{syn}}(t) (V(t) - E_{\text{rev}})
 \tag{3.3}
 ```

Here, $g_{\text{syn}}(t)$ represents the time-dependent synaptic conductance (e.g., modeled as an exponential decay or alpha function triggered by the presynaptic spike), $V(t)$ is the current membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron, and $E_{\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential for the synapse type. This model is more biologically realistic because the magnitude and even the direction of the synaptic current depend dynamically on the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential. For example, an excitatory synapse ($E_{\text{rev}} \approx 0 \, \text{mV}$) will cause a large inward current (depolarization) when the neuron is near rest (e.g., -70 mV), but a much smaller current if the neuron is already depolarized near 0 mV. An inhibitory synapse ($E_{\text{rev}} \approx -75 \, \text{mV}$) will cause an outward current (hyperpolarization) if the neuron is depolarized above -75 mV, but an inward current if the neuron is hyperpolarized below -75 mV (though it still acts functionally inhibitory by pulling the potential towards $E_{\text{rev}}$). Furthermore, conductance changes can affect the neuron's input resistance ($R = 1/g_{\text{total}}$), influencing how it integrates other inputs (shunting inhibition). While computationally slightly more demanding than current-based models (as $I_{\text{syn}}$ now depends on $V$), conductance-based models provide greater biophysical fidelity and are often preferred when accurately modeling synaptic integration or the effects of E/I balance is important. Brian2 supports both current-based and conductance-based synaptic models.

**3.5 Neural Coding (Rate, Temporal, Population)**

A fundamental question in neuroscience is how information about the external world, internal states, or intended actions is represented or **encoded** in the electrical activity of neurons. Understanding the **neural code** is crucial for interpreting brain function and for designing effective ways to input information into and decode results from computational systems based on neural principles, such as Organoid Computing platforms. Several coding schemes have been proposed and are thought to operate, often in parallel or depending on the specific brain area and context.

The oldest and perhaps most intuitive coding scheme is **rate coding**. In this framework, information is primarily encoded in the **average firing rate** of a neuron over a certain time window. A stronger stimulus might elicit a higher firing rate, while a weaker stimulus elicits a lower rate. For example, the perceived brightness of a light might be encoded by the firing rate of neurons in the visual pathway, or the force of a muscle contraction might be encoded by the firing rate of motor neurons. This scheme assumes that the precise timing of individual spikes within the window is largely irrelevant, carrying little or no information beyond contributing to the average rate. Rate coding is computationally convenient, relatively robust to noise, and has experimental support in many sensory and motor systems, particularly for encoding stimulus intensity or static features. However, it can be slow, as averaging requires integrating activity over potentially long time windows, which seems incompatible with the rapid processing speeds observed in many biological computations.

An alternative perspective emphasizes the importance of **temporal coding**, suggesting that information is encoded in the **precise timing** of individual action potentials, or in the high-frequency patterns of spikes (e.g., bursts), relative to ongoing network oscillations or the timing of spikes from other neurons. In this view, a single spike occurring at a specific moment might carry significant information. Examples include the encoding of sound location in the auditory brainstem, which relies on sub-millisecond differences in spike arrival times from the two ears, or potential coding schemes involving spike sequences or synchrony between different neurons. Temporal codes offer potentially much higher information capacity and faster processing than rate codes, as information can be transmitted with just a few precisely timed spikes. However, they are generally thought to be more sensitive to noise and require mechanisms for generating and decoding precise spike timing, which might be metabolically expensive. The relative importance of rate versus temporal coding is still a subject of active research and likely varies depending on the neural system and the nature of the information being processed.

A third major coding principle is **population coding**. This framework posits that information is often represented not by the activity of a single neuron, but by the **collective activity** distributed across a large population of neurons. Individual neurons might be broadly tuned (i.e., respond to a range of stimuli), and their responses can be noisy or ambiguous. However, by combining the signals from many such neurons, a much more precise and reliable representation can be achieved. A classic example is the encoding of movement direction in the motor cortex, where individual neurons fire most strongly for a preferred direction but also fire less for nearby directions. The actual movement direction is thought to be accurately represented by the **vector average** of the activity across the entire population of tuned neurons. Population codes can represent high-dimensional information efficiently, provide robustness against the failure or noise of individual neurons, and allow for complex computations through interactions within the population. Many sophisticated brain functions, including sensory perception, decision-making, and motor control, are thought to rely heavily on population coding principles. Understanding how information is represented across populations will be crucial for interpreting the complex activity patterns observed in brain organoids and simulated networks. It is likely that neural systems utilize a combination of rate, temporal, and population coding strategies simultaneously to represent information efficiently and robustly.

`[Conceptual Figure 3.5: Neural Coding Schemes. Panel (a) Rate Coding: Shows two spike trains; top trace (low rate) corresponds to weak stimulus, bottom trace (high rate) corresponds to strong stimulus. Panel (b) Temporal Coding: Shows two spike trains with the same average rate but different precise spike timings relative to a reference signal (e.g., an oscillation), encoding different information. Panel (c) Population Coding: Shows several neurons (rows) firing over time (columns). Each neuron has a preferred stimulus feature (e.g., direction). Information about the actual stimulus is encoded in the pattern of activity across the whole population (e.g., indicated by a population vector calculation).]`

**3.6 Brian2 Implementation: Simulating a Single LIF Neuron**

Having established the fundamental concepts of single neuron modeling, we now turn to our first practical implementation using the **Brian2 simulator**. This example will demonstrate how to define and simulate the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model introduced in Section 3.3, providing a hands-on introduction to the core workflow and syntax of Brian2. Our goal is to create a single LIF neuron, inject a constant step current into it, and observe how its membrane potential evolves over time, eventually leading to the generation of action potentials (spikes). This simple simulation illustrates the basic principles of neuronal integration and firing and serves as a building block for the more complex network simulations we will construct later.

Now, let's implement this for a single LIF neuron receiving a step current.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **Import:** We import `brian2`'s functions and objects using `from brian2 import *`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
2.  **Parameters:** We define the LIF parameters (`tau`, `V_rest`, etc.) using Brian2's unit system (e.g., `10*ms`). This prevents unit errors and ensures biological plausibility.
3.  **Equations:** The `lif_eqs` string defines the differential equation for the membrane potential `v`. Note that Brian2 uses `v` as the default symbol for the first state variable defined in the equation string unless specified otherwise. We explicitly declare `I_inj` as an external parameter of type `amp` (amperes) that we can set and change during the simulation. The `(unless refractory)` flag instructs Brian2 to halt the integration of this equation during the refractory period following a spike.
4.  **NeuronGroup:** We create a `NeuronGroup` object named `neuron` containing `N=1` neuron. We pass the equations string (`model=lif_eqs`), the condition that triggers a spike (`threshold='v > V_thresh'`), the operation(s) performed immediately after a spike (`reset='v = V_reset'`), the duration of the absolute refractory period (`refractory=t_ref`), and specify the numerical integration method (`method='euler'`). The Euler method is a simple and fast first-order integration scheme suitable for this basic example.
5.  **Initial Conditions:** We explicitly set the initial membrane potential `neuron.v` to the resting potential `V_rest` and initialize the injected current `neuron.I_inj` to `0*nA` before the simulation starts.
6.  **Monitors:** We create two monitor objects to record data during the simulation. The `StateMonitor` is configured to record the state variable `'v'` from the neuron at index `0` (`record=0`). The `SpikeMonitor` is associated with the `neuron` group and automatically records the index of the neuron that spiked (always 0 in this case) and the precise time of each spike event.
7.  **Run Simulation:** We first use `store()` to save the current state of the network (including initial conditions). This is useful if we want to run multiple simulation trials starting from the same point. We then execute the simulation in three stages using the `run(duration)` command. First, we run for 20 ms with zero injected current. Then, we set `neuron.I_inj` to a non-zero value (`0.25*nA`) sufficient to drive the neuron above threshold and run for another 80 ms. During this period, we expect the neuron to fire action potentials. Finally, we turn the injected current back off (`neuron.I_inj = 0*nA`) and run for a final 50 ms to observe the neuron returning towards its resting state.
8.  **Analyze and Visualize:** After the simulation completes, we access the recorded data stored within the monitor objects. `state_monitor.t` contains the time points at which the state variable was recorded, and `state_monitor.v[0]` contains the corresponding membrane potential values for the first (and only) neuron. `spike_monitor.t` contains the times of all recorded spikes. We use Matplotlib to generate a plot of the membrane potential trace over time, converting the values to milliseconds (`/ms`) and millivolts (`/mV`) for easier interpretation. A dashed red line indicates the spike threshold `V_thresh`. We also print the recorded spike times to the console. Optionally, we add red stars (`r*`) to the voltage plot at the approximate times when spikes occurred, retrieving the corresponding voltage values from the `state_monitor` data. Finally, we print the total number of spikes recorded using `spike_monitor.num_spikes` and display the plot using `plt.show()`.

Running this code will produce a plot clearly showing the LIF neuron's behavior: starting at $V_{\text{rest}}$, rising towards a steady state when current is injected, firing repeatedly upon reaching $V_{\text{thresh}}$, resetting to $V_{\text{reset}}$, exhibiting the refractory period, and finally relaxing back towards $V_{\text{rest}}$ when the current is removed. This simple yet illustrative example encapsulates the fundamental workflow of using Brian2 for simulating spiking neurons, providing the essential practical foundation upon which we will build in the subsequent chapters to explore more complex network dynamics and computations.

**3.7 Conclusion and Planned Code**

This chapter has laid the crucial groundwork for understanding and modeling the computational properties of neurons, the fundamental building blocks relevant to Organoid Computing. We navigated the different levels of modeling abstraction, establishing the single neuron as a key computational unit. We reviewed the principles of the biophysically detailed Hodgkin-Huxley model and then focused on the utility and mathematical formulation of simplified models, detailing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron and providing an overview of other important models like QIF, EIF, AdEx, and Izhikevich. The mechanisms of basic synaptic transmission, including EPSPs, IPSPs, and the distinction between current-based and conductance-based models, were explained. We also explored the primary ways information is thought to be encoded in neural activity through rate, temporal, and population codes. Most importantly, this chapter provided the first concrete, hands-on introduction to the Brian2 simulator by guiding the reader through the implementation, execution, and visualization of a single LIF neuron simulation. This example illustrated core Brian2 concepts such as defining equations with units, creating `NeuronGroup` objects, using `StateMonitor` and `SpikeMonitor`, and running the simulation using `run()`. The skills and concepts introduced here are foundational for the subsequent chapters, where we will expand from single neurons to simulating interconnected networks, incorporating synaptic plasticity, and exploring how these simulated organoid-inspired networks can perform computations.

**Planned Code Example:**
*   **`3.1_SingleLIFNeuron.ipynb`:** (Provided and explained in Section 3.6) Simulates a single Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron receiving a step current input, demonstrating basic Brian2 usage, model definition, monitoring, and plotting of membrane potential and spike times. (Jupyter Notebook format suggested for interactive exploration).
