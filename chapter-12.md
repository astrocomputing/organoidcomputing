# Modeling Glial Contributions to Neural Network Dynamics

----

*Up to this point, our computational exploration has largely adhered to a neuron-centric view of brain function, focusing almost exclusively on the dynamics and interactions of neurons and their synapses. However, the brain is far more than just a network of neurons. It contains a vast population of non-neuronal cells collectively known as **glia**, which outnumber neurons in many brain regions and constitute a significant fraction of the brain's volume. Traditionally viewed as mere structural support or "glue" (hence the name), providing metabolic sustenance and insulation, the past few decades have revolutionized our understanding, revealing glia as **active participants** in nearly every aspect of brain development, function, plasticity, and pathology. Glial cells engage in intricate, **bidirectional communication** with neurons, dynamically regulate the critical **neuronal microenvironment**, profoundly influence **synaptic transmission and plasticity**, contribute centrally to brain **metabolism** and blood flow regulation, actively **modulate network activity** patterns, and orchestrate the brain's response to **injury and infection**. Ignoring the multifaceted contributions of these "other brain cells" provides an incomplete, and potentially fundamentally misleading, picture of how neural circuits operate and compute. This chapter delves into the significant challenge and growing necessity of incorporating glial functions into our computational models of neural networks, particularly relevant for understanding complex systems like brain organoids where neuron-glia interactions co-develop. We begin by **highlighting in greater detail why modeling glia is important** for achieving biological realism and capturing key computational mechanisms, briefly introducing the major glial types relevant to computation in the CNS: **astrocytes**, **oligodendrocytes**, and **microglia**. We then dedicate expanded sections to discussing the key known functions of each glial type and exploring **conceptual and practical strategies for modeling their influence** on neuronal and synaptic activity within a simulation framework like Brian2. Specifically, we delve deeper into **astrocyte roles in ion homeostasis (K+ buffering)**, **neurotransmitter uptake (glutamate clearance)**, and **calcium signaling leading to gliotransmission**; the critical impact of **oligodendrocytes on action potential conduction velocity via myelination**; and the dynamic roles of **microglia in synaptic pruning during development and plasticity, and their complex involvement in neuroinflammation**. We explicitly address the substantial **challenges and unavoidable simplifications** inherent in modeling these complex, often slow, spatially distributed, and biochemically intricate glial processes, particularly within simulation platforms primarily optimized for neuronal point-network dynamics. Finally, the chapter provides more concrete **Brian2 implementation examples**, illustrating how the *functional consequences* of these glial activities might be approximated by dynamically modulating neuronal or synaptic parameters within simulations, while carefully acknowledging the simplified and phenomenological nature of these implementations.*

**12.1 The "Other Brain Cells": Why Model Glia?**

For much of neuroscience history, the computational spotlight shone almost exclusively on neurons. Glial cells—predominantly **astrocytes** (star-shaped cells providing metabolic support, maintaining homeostasis, and forming part of the tripartite synapse), **oligodendrocytes** (responsible for myelination in the CNS), **microglia** (the resident immune cells of the brain), and other types like NG2 glia (oligodendrocyte precursors with signaling roles) and ependymal cells (lining ventricles)—were often treated as passive background players. They were seen as providing essential but computationally uninteresting services: structural support holding neurons in place, metabolic fuel delivery, electrical insulation via myelin, and basic housekeeping. However, propelled by advances in experimental techniques (especially imaging and genetic tools), a paradigm shift has occurred over the past three decades. It is now unequivocally clear that glia are not merely passive bystanders but **active, dynamic partners** engaged in constant, complex communication with neurons and with each other, profoundly influencing virtually all aspects of brain function from the synaptic level to network computations and behavior (Fields et al., 2014;ULATION_NEEDED; Nimmerjahn & Bergles, 2023; Santello et al., 2019;ULATION_NEEDED; Verkhratsky & Nedergaard, 2018;ULATION_NEEDED).

Integrating glial functions into computational models of neural networks, including those inspired by brain organoids, is becoming increasingly critical for several compelling reasons:

1.  **Regulating the Neural Milieu - The Stage for Computation:** Neuronal firing and synaptic transmission depend exquisitely on the precise ionic and chemical composition of the extracellular fluid. Glia, especially astrocytes, act as master regulators of this microenvironment (Section 12.2, 12.3). They dynamically buffer extracellular potassium ($K^+$) released during action potentials, preventing hyperexcitability. They rapidly clear neurotransmitters like glutamate from synaptic clefts, ensuring signal fidelity and preventing excitotoxicity. They provide crucial metabolic substrates (like lactate derived from glucose) to fuel the high energy demands of neuronal activity (Peng et al., 2023). They also regulate water balance and extracellular volume. Models that neglect these homeostatic functions implicitly assume an ideal, infinitely stable extracellular environment, potentially missing critical activity-dependent constraints, feedback loops, and failure modes that shape real network dynamics and limit computational capacity. For instance, impaired $K^+$ buffering can dramatically lower the threshold for seizure generation, a phenomenon invisible in models lacking this dependency.

2.  **Active Modulation of Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity:** The discovery of the **tripartite synapse**—comprising the presynaptic terminal, the postsynaptic density, and the surrounding astrocyte processes—revolutionized our view of synaptic function (Murphy-Royal et al., 2022). Astrocytes express receptors for neurotransmitters released by neurons, allowing them to "listen" to synaptic activity. This detection often triggers intracellular calcium signals within the astrocyte, which, in turn, can lead to the release of various **gliotransmitters** (Section 12.4). These astrocyte-derived signals (e.g., glutamate, ATP/adenosine, D-serine) act back on neuronal receptors (pre- or postsynaptic) to dynamically modulate synaptic strength (both short-term efficacy and long-term plasticity like LTP/LTD) and neuronal excitability (Henneberger et al., 2020;ULATION_NEEDED; Santello et al., 2019;ULATION_NEEDED). Furthermore, microglia constantly interact with synapses, contributing to their elimination (pruning) during development and potentially modifying their function through released factors (Section 12.6). Ignoring these glial inputs means overlooking a crucial layer of regulation that shapes information flow and learning rules within neural circuits.

3.  **Shaping Network Dynamics and Synchronization:** Through their influence on the extracellular environment, synaptic efficacy, and neuronal excitability, glia can significantly impact emergent network-level phenomena. Astrocyte spatial buffering of $K^+$ (Section 12.2) or modulation via gliotransmission (Section 12.4) can influence the propensity of networks to synchronize or generate oscillations. Propagating calcium waves within the astrocyte syncytium (networks of astrocytes coupled by gap junctions) might coordinate activity or plasticity across spatially distributed neuronal ensembles (Nimmerjahn & Bergles, 2023). Oligodendrocyte myelination (Section 12.5) critically determines signal propagation delays, profoundly affecting the timing of interactions and the stability of synchronous states in large networks (He et al., 2022). Microglial activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators (Section 12.6) can drastically alter network dynamics, often suppressing normal activity patterns and potentially contributing to pathological states (Badimon et al., 2020;ULATION_NEEDED; Galloway et al., 2022). Models lacking glial components may fail to reproduce experimentally observed network states or transitions.

4.  **Essential Roles in Development and Structural Plasticity:** Glia are indispensable architects of the brain. Astrocytes guide neuronal migration, promote the formation and maturation of synapses (synaptogenesis), and, along with microglia, play key roles in eliminating unnecessary or weak synapses through **phagocytosis** (synaptic pruning) during critical developmental periods (Allen & Eroglu, 2017;ULATION_NEEDED; Wilton et al., 2022). This glial-mediated structural remodeling is crucial for refining neural circuits based on activity and experience. Oligodendrocytes perform activity-dependent myelination, further shaping circuit function. Since brain organoids recapitulate aspects of early development, including the generation and interaction of neurons and glia, modeling these developmental roles (particularly pruning and myelination effects) might be essential for understanding the resulting structure and function of organoid networks.

5.  **Central Involvement in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders:** Glial dysfunction is no longer seen as just a consequence of neuronal pathology but is increasingly recognized as a primary driver or critical contributor to a wide range of brain disorders. Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis, altered astrocyte homeostasis, deficient myelination (demyelinating diseases like MS), and chronic neuroinflammation orchestrated by microglia are implicated in epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, autism spectrum disorders, depression, and schizophrenia (Galloway et al., 2022; Kwon & Koh, 2020;ULATION_NEEDED; Quintana, 2023). Developing effective therapies may require targeting glial pathways. Computational models incorporating glial roles are therefore vital tools for investigating disease mechanisms *in silico* and testing the potential impact of glia-targeted interventions.

Given this profound and multifaceted involvement of glia in nearly all aspects of brain function, building truly comprehensive and predictive computational models, especially for complex systems like developing brain organoids where neuron-glia interactions are dynamically established and potentially crucial for emergent function (Hartung et al., 2024), necessitates moving beyond a purely neuron-centric approach. However, as discussed in Section 12.7, realistically modeling glia presents formidable challenges, often forcing us to adopt simplified, phenomenological approaches to capture their *functional impact* within neuron-focused simulation frameworks like Brian2.

**12.2 Modeling Astrocytes I: Ion Homeostasis (Potassium Buffering)**

Perhaps the most immediate and critical homeostatic function performed by astrocytes is the regulation of **extracellular potassium concentration**, $[K^+]_{ext}$. Neuronal electrical activity intrinsically involves transmembrane ion fluxes. During the repolarization phase of each action potential, voltage-gated potassium channels open, allowing $K^+$ ions to flow out of the neuron into the relatively small volume of the extracellular space (ECS). While the efflux from a single spike is small, intense or synchronous firing by many neurons in a local region can lead to a significant, transient accumulation of $K^+$ in the ECS.

This accumulation has direct consequences for neuronal excitability. The **Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium ($E_K$)**, a key determinant of the neuronal resting membrane potential and the driving force for repolarizing currents, is highly sensitive to changes in $[K^+]_{ext}$ (Equation 12.1). Specifically, an increase in $[K^+]_{ext}$ makes $E_K$ less negative (depolarizes it). This depolarization of $E_K$ shifts the neuronal resting membrane potential towards threshold, making neurons intrinsically more excitable and prone to firing. Furthermore, a reduced driving force for $K^+$ currents can slow down action potential repolarization, potentially broadening spikes and affecting neurotransmitter release. If $[K^+]_{ext}$ rises excessively (e.g., >10-12 mM, compared to a baseline of ~3-4 mM), it can trigger spontaneous neuronal firing, network hyperexcitability, and potentially lead to the generation and propagation of seizures. Therefore, efficient mechanisms must exist to buffer or clear excess $K^+$ from the ECS to maintain network stability.

**Astrocytes** are perfectly positioned and equipped to perform this vital **potassium buffering** role. Their processes extensively infiltrate the neuropil, closely enveloping neuronal somata, dendrites, and synapses. They possess several key molecular mechanisms for rapidly taking up $K^+$ ions from the ECS when levels rise:
1.  **Na+/K+-ATPase Pump:** These ubiquitous pumps use ATP hydrolysis to actively transport 3 $Na^+$ ions out of the astrocyte for every 2 $K^+$ ions pumped in. The pump rate increases significantly when either intracellular $Na^+$ or extracellular $K^+$ concentrations rise, making it a primary mechanism for activity-dependent $K^+$ uptake.
2.  **Inward Rectifier Potassium Channels (Kir4.1):** Astrocytes express high densities of Kir4.1 channels, which have a high conductance for $K^+$ influx when the membrane potential is more negative than $E_K$, but conduct poorly outward. Since astrocytes typically have a very negative resting potential (around -80 to -90 mV, largely set by $K^+$ conductance), they readily take up $K^+$ through Kir channels whenever $[K^+]_{ext}$ rises above baseline levels (depolarizing $E_K$).
3.  **Na+-K+-2Cl- Cotransporter (NKCC1):** This transporter moves $Na^+$, $K^+$, and $2Cl^-$ ions together into the cell, driven primarily by the $Na^+$ gradient. It can contribute significantly to $K^+$ uptake, especially under conditions of high neuronal activity.
4.  **Spatial Buffering via Gap Junctions:** Astrocytes are extensively interconnected with neighboring astrocytes through **gap junctions**, forming a vast **astrocyte syncytium**. This network allows ions and small molecules, including $K^+$, to diffuse readily from one astrocyte to another. Consequently, $K^+$ taken up by astrocytes in a region of high neuronal activity can rapidly diffuse through the syncytium to areas with lower activity and lower $[K^+]_{ext}$, where it can then be released back into the ECS or buffered locally. This "spatial buffering" mechanism effectively dissipates local $K^+$ hotspots across a larger tissue volume, greatly increasing the overall buffering capacity (Kofuji & Newman, 2004;ULATION_NEEDED).

The efficiency of this combined astrocyte buffering system is critical. Factors affecting astrocyte metabolism (e.g., glucose availability affecting ATP for pumps), Kir4.1 channel function (mutations cause epilepsy), or gap junction coupling can significantly impair $K^+$ clearance and increase network susceptibility to hyperexcitability.

**Modeling Astrocyte $K^+$ Buffering Effects:** Incorporating the full biophysical detail of astrocyte pumps, channels, intracellular diffusion, gap junction coupling, and interaction with the ECS diffusion dynamics into a network simulation is computationally prohibitive for large systems. However, we can model the **functional consequences** of impaired or effective buffering on neuronal activity within Brian2 using simplified approaches:

1.  **Activity-Dependent $E_K$ Modulation (Implicit Buffering):** This approach avoids modeling $K^+$ concentration directly. Instead, we make the potassium reversal potential $E_K$ used in the neuron model a dynamic variable that depends on a proxy measure of recent local network activity.
    *   **Activity Proxy:** Estimate local activity using, e.g., a `PopulationRateMonitor` applied to a subset of neurons, or by adding a variable to each neuron that filters its own spike train (`dr/dt = -r/tau_rate; reset: r += 1/tau_rate`).
    *   **$E_K$ Dynamics:** Define $E_K$ dynamics such that it depolarizes when the activity proxy is high and decays back to a baseline $E_{K,base}$ with a time constant $\tau_{buffer}$ that conceptually represents the buffering efficiency (faster decay = better buffering).
    ```python
    # Conceptual Brian2 Snippet: Dynamic EK per Neuron based on Filtered Rate
    EK_base = -80*mV; EK_max_shift = 15*mV; tau_rate_filter = 50*ms; tau_buffer = 200*ms
    rate_sensitivity = 0.5*mV/Hz # How much EK shifts per Hz rate increase
    eqs_k_dyn = '''
    dv/dt = ... - gK*(v - EK_dyn) ... : volt # Neuron eq using dynamic EK
    drate_proxy/dt = -rate_proxy / tau_rate_filter : Hz (event-driven) # Filtered rate proxy per neuron
    dEK_dyn/dt = (EK_base + rate_sensitivity*rate_proxy - EK_dyn) / tau_buffer : volt # EK tracks rate with buffering delay
    ...'''
    # NeuronGroup setup with reset: '...; rate_proxy += 1.0/tau_rate_filter'
    neurons = NeuronGroup(N, eqs_k_dyn, ...)
    neurons.EK_dyn = EK_base
    # Monitor EK_dyn and rate_proxy to observe effect
    ```
    *(Self-correction: Implemented the activity-dependent EK using a per-neuron filtered rate proxy `rate_proxy` and dynamic `EK_dyn` variable relaxing towards a rate-dependent target, capturing the effect more locally and dynamically within the neuron's equations.)* This approach captures the core feedback loop: firing increases local rate proxy, which increases target EK, which depolarizes `EK_dyn` with delay `tau_buffer`, making the neuron more excitable, potentially leading to more firing until buffering catches up.

2.  **Simplified Extracellular $K^+$ Variable:** Introduce an explicit state variable `K_ext_deviation` representing the deviation of $[K^+]_{ext}$ from baseline, perhaps averaged over a small region or associated with each neuron.
    *   Spikes cause an increment to `K_ext_deviation`.
    *   `K_ext_deviation` decays back to zero with time constant `tau_buffer` representing buffering.
    *   Neuronal $E_K$ is calculated based on `baseline_K + K_ext_deviation` using the Nernst equation (or a linearization).
    ```python
    # Conceptual Snippet: Explicit K_ext variable (Shared locally or per-neuron)
    # This is harder to implement efficiently for local sharing in Brian2 without custom extensions.
    # Per-neuron version:
    # eqs_k_explicit = '''...
    #          dK_ext_dev/dt = -K_ext_dev / tau_buffer : mole/meter**3 (event-driven) # Buffering decay
    #          EK = EK_Nernst_func(K_base_ext + K_ext_dev) : volt # EK depends on K_ext
    #          ...'''
    # Reset: '... K_ext_dev += K_inc_per_spike' # K+ release on spike
    ```
These conceptual models, while simplified, allow simulations to explore how astrocyte buffering capacity (parameterized by `tau_buffer` or related factors) critically influences network excitability, stability against high-frequency firing, and the potential emergence of pathological synchronization or seizures in response to activity-dependent changes in the ionic microenvironment.

**12.3 Modeling Astrocytes II: Neurotransmitter Uptake (Glutamate Clearance)**

Beyond ionic balance, astrocytes play an equally critical role in regulating the chemical milieu of the synapse by rapidly **clearing neurotransmitters**, primarily the major excitatory transmitter **glutamate**, from the extracellular space. Efficient glutamate uptake is essential for ensuring the precision and fidelity of excitatory synaptic transmission and for preventing neuronal damage from excessive stimulation (excitotoxicity).

During synaptic transmission, glutamate is released from the presynaptic terminal into the narrow synaptic cleft (~20-30 nm wide). It diffuses across the cleft and binds to postsynaptic receptors, primarily AMPA receptors (AMPARs, mediating fast excitatory currents) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs, mediating slower currents and crucial for plasticity, requiring both glutamate binding and postsynaptic depolarization). To terminate the signal rapidly and allow for subsequent independent transmission events, this released glutamate must be quickly removed. While diffusion plays a role, the primary clearance mechanism involves active transport into surrounding cells. **Astrocytes**, whose fine processes extensively ensheath synapses, express exceptionally high densities of **Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs)** on their membranes. The two main astrocyte transporters are **GLT-1** (also known as EAAT2 in humans) and **GLAST** (EAAT1). These transporters bind glutamate with high affinity in the extracellular space and co-transport it into the astrocyte cytoplasm along with three $Na^+$ ions and one $H^+$ ion, while counter-transporting one $K^+$ ion out. This process is energetically demanding, relying on the steep $Na^+$ gradient maintained by the astrocyte Na+/K+-ATPase pump.

Inside the astrocyte, the sequestered glutamate is rapidly converted into **glutamine** by the enzyme **glutamine synthetase**, which is exclusively expressed in astrocytes. Glutamine is then released by astrocytes and taken up by neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory). Neurons use glutamine as a precursor to synthesize new glutamate (via glutaminase in excitatory neurons) or GABA (via GAD in inhibitory neurons). This **glutamate-glutamine cycle** is crucial for replenishing neurotransmitter pools and sustaining synaptic activity.

The **efficiency of astrocyte glutamate uptake** by EAATs profoundly impacts synaptic signaling and network function:
*   **EPSP/EPSC Kinetics:** Faster uptake leads to a shorter duration of glutamate presence in the cleft, resulting in faster decay times for AMPAR-mediated EPSCs/EPSPs. Impaired uptake (e.g., due to transporter blockers, reduced expression, or metabolic failure) prolongs the synaptic current.
*   **Synaptic Crosstalk (Spillover):** Efficient uptake largely confines glutamate signaling to the synapse where it was released. If uptake is compromised or overwhelmed by massive release (e.g., during high-frequency stimulation or seizures), glutamate can diffuse out of the cleft (**spillover**) and activate receptors at neighboring synapses or **extrasynaptic receptors** located away from the primary release site. This spillover can lead to unwanted activation of adjacent pathways (crosstalk) and activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs, which may trigger different signaling cascades (potentially related to excitotoxicity or metaplasticity).
*   **Receptor Desensitization:** Prolonged exposure to glutamate can cause AMPARs and NMDARs to enter desensitized (non-conducting) states. Efficient clearance minimizes receptor desensitization, allowing synapses to follow high-frequency inputs more reliably.
*   **Excitotoxicity Prevention:** By maintaining very low baseline levels of extracellular glutamate (~micromolar range) and rapidly clearing synaptically released glutamate, astrocyte transporters protect neurons from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, which can occur if glutamate levels remain high for too long, leading to excessive $Ca^{2+}$ influx via NMDARs and subsequent cell death pathways.

**Modeling Astrocyte Glutamate Uptake Effects:** As with ion buffering, detailed modeling of glutamate diffusion, transporter kinetics, and the glutamate-glutamine cycle requires complex spatio-temporal models. However, within Brian2 simulations using simpler point neurons and synapses, we can conceptually model the *consequences* of altered glutamate uptake efficiency, primarily focusing on its impact on synaptic kinetics and potential spillover effects:

1.  **Modulating Synaptic Decay Time Constant ($\tau_{syn}$):** The most direct effect of uptake is on the duration of glutamate in the cleft, which influences the decay of fast synaptic currents (primarily AMPAR-mediated).
    *   In conductance-based synapse models (e.g., `dg_E/dt = -g_E / tau_E`), the decay time constant `tau_E` can be made dependent on a conceptual `astro_uptake_efficiency` parameter (ranging, e.g., 0 to 1).
    *   Define an effective decay time `tau_E_eff = tau_E_base * (1 + decay_modulation * (1 - astro_uptake_efficiency))`. Lower efficiency (closer to 0) leads to longer `tau_E_eff`.
    *   The `astro_uptake_efficiency` could be a fixed parameter representing the astrocyte state, or potentially made dynamic, decreasing during periods of simulated high activity to represent transporter saturation.
    ```python
    # Conceptual Brian2 Snippet: Uptake Affects Synaptic Tau
    # Assume synapse model: dg_E/dt = -g_E / tau_E_eff : siemens
    # Where tau_E_eff is a parameter of the synapse or target neuron
    tau_E_base = 4*ms
    decay_modulation_factor = 3.0 # How much tau increases with impaired uptake

    # Assume 'astro_uptake_efficiency' is a variable (e.g., 0.9 for healthy)
    # This variable could be set globally or potentially dynamically updated
    astro_uptake_efficiency = 0.9

    # Calculate effective tau (e.g., before simulation or using @network_operation)
    effective_tau_E = tau_E_base * (1 + decay_modulation_factor * (1 - astro_uptake_efficiency))

    # Set this value for the synapse parameter
    # ExcitatorySynapses.tau_E_eff = effective_tau_E
    ```
    *(Self-correction: Formula adjusted so lower efficiency leads to longer tau.)* Simulating with different `astro_uptake_efficiency` values would show how slower clearance prolongs EPSPs, potentially leading to increased temporal summation and network excitability.

2.  **Modeling Spillover (Conceptual Rule-Based):** Simulating spillover effects accurately requires spatial representation. Conceptually, one might implement rules where:
    *   High-frequency presynaptic firing (above a threshold) triggers not only the primary postsynaptic response but also weaker, delayed responses in neighboring neurons (representing spillover activation).
    *   Introduce a separate synaptic conductance variable representing extrasynaptic receptors (e.g., slow NMDARs) which gets activated only when a measure of local glutamate concentration (perhaps proxied by high sustained presynaptic activity or saturated uptake) exceeds a threshold.
    *   Make the parameters controlling these spillover effects inversely dependent on the `astro_uptake_efficiency`.

These conceptual implementations, while abstracting away the detailed biophysics, allow modelers to incorporate the critical role of astrocyte glutamate clearance into network simulations. By varying the parameters representing uptake efficiency, one can investigate how astrocyte function impacts synaptic integration timing, prevents hyperexcitability, limits crosstalk, and maintains the fidelity of information processing in simulated circuits inspired by organoids or other brain regions.

**12.4 Modeling Astrocytes III: Gliotransmission**

Beyond their crucial homeostatic roles in managing the extracellular environment, astrocytes are now understood to be **active participants in synaptic signaling** itself, engaging in bidirectional communication with neurons at the **tripartite synapse** (Murphy-Royal et al., 2022). Astrocytes are not electrically excitable in the same way as neurons (they don't fire action potentials), but they exhibit a form of excitability based on fluctuations in their intracellular calcium concentration ($[Ca^{2+}]_i$).

Astrocytes express a wide array of **receptors** on their processes that allow them to detect neurotransmitters and neuromodulators released by nearby neurons and other cells. Key examples include:
*   Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs, especially Group I)
*   Purinergic receptors (P2Y for ATP/ADP, A1/A2A for adenosine)
*   GABA receptors (GABA_B)
*   Adrenergic receptors (for norepinephrine)
*   Acetylcholine receptors (muscarinic)
*   Cannabinoid receptors (CB1)
*   Receptors for peptides and growth factors.

Activation of many of these receptors, particularly Gq-protein coupled receptors like mGluR5 or P2Y1, triggers intracellular signaling cascades that lead to the release of $Ca^{2+}$ from internal stores (primarily the endoplasmic reticulum, via $IP_3$ receptor activation) and potentially influx from the extracellular space. This results in transient increases in astrocyte $[Ca^{2+}]_i$. These calcium signals can be highly localized to specific microdomains within astrocyte processes near active synapses, or they can propagate as regenerative waves within a single astrocyte, or even spread to neighboring astrocytes through gap junctions, potentially coordinating glial activity over larger spatial scales (Nimmerjahn & Bergles, 2023).

The crucial functional consequence of these astrocyte calcium elevations is that they can trigger the release of various neuroactive substances, known as **gliotransmitters**, from the astrocyte into the extracellular space (Savtchouk & Volterra, 2018;ULATION_NEEDED; Yi et al., 2023). The precise mechanisms of release (e.g., vesicular exocytosis similar to neurons, channel-mediated release) are still debated and may vary for different gliotransmitters and conditions. Key identified gliotransmitters and their potential effects include:
*   **Glutamate:** Released glutamate from astrocytes can activate neuronal NMDA receptors (often extrasynaptic ones), potentially triggering slow inward currents (SICs) in nearby neurons, modulating neuronal excitability, and influencing synaptic plasticity thresholds.
*   **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** Released ATP can activate neuronal P2X receptors (ligand-gated ion channels, often excitatory) or P2Y receptors (metabotropic). ATP is rapidly degraded extracellularly to adenosine.
*   **Adenosine:** Generated from ATP breakdown, adenosine primarily acts on neuronal A1 receptors (inhibitory, reducing neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic excitability) and A2A receptors (often facilitatory). ATP/adenosine signaling provides complex, temporally evolving modulation of synaptic strength and neuronal firing.
*   **D-serine:** This amino acid acts as a necessary co-agonist (along with glutamate) for synaptic NMDA receptors. Astrocytes are a major source of D-serine in many brain regions. By controlling the availability of D-serine, astrocytes can gate the activation of NMDARs and thereby play a critical role in regulating NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity (LTP/LTD) and learning (Henneberger et al., 2020;ULATION_NEEDED).
*   **GABA:** Evidence suggests some astrocytes might release GABA, potentially contributing to tonic inhibition (a persistent, low-level inhibitory tone) that regulates overall network excitability.

Through the release of these various gliotransmitters, triggered by their own activity-dependent calcium signals, astrocytes can exert powerful **modulatory influences** on neighboring neurons and synapses. This modulation can occur over diverse timescales, ranging from hundreds of milliseconds (related to calcium transient duration) to many seconds or minutes (due to downstream effects of metabotropic receptor activation or changes in plasticity). Potential functional roles include: fine-tuning synaptic strength, gating plasticity induction, regulating neuronal firing thresholds, contributing to homeostasis by balancing excitation/inhibition, and potentially synchronizing activity across local neuronal ensembles. The specific effects depend heavily on the type of gliotransmitter released, the receptors present on the neuronal targets, and the context of ongoing network activity (Murphy-Royal et al., 2022).

**Modeling Astrocyte Gliotransmission Effects:** Simulating the full detail of astrocyte intracellular calcium dynamics, gliotransmitter release mechanisms, diffusion, and receptor interactions is computationally intensive and requires specialized modeling approaches often focused on single tripartite synapses or small motifs (Yi et al., 2023). Within larger network simulations using Brian2, the focus is typically on capturing the **net functional impact** of gliotransmission conceptually:

1.  **Model Astrocyte Activation State:** Define a variable representing astrocyte activation, driven by local neural activity. This could be a simple filtered version of the local firing rate or summed synaptic activity, potentially with a threshold.
    ```python
    # Conceptual: Astrocyte activation proxy per neuron
    # tau_astro_rise = 50*ms; tau_astro_decay = 500*ms; astro_act_threshold = 0.5 # Unitless
    # eqs_astro = '''...
    #      dActivity_proxy/dt = -Activity_proxy / tau_astro_rise : 1 (event-driven) # Fast rise on spike
    #      dAstro_act/dt = (Activity_proxy - Astro_act) / tau_astro_decay : 1 # Slow decay, tracks activity
    #      ...'''
    # Reset: '... Activity_proxy += 1 ...' # Increment activity on spike
    # Gliotransmission occurs when Astro_act > astro_act_threshold
    ```

2.  **Implement Activity-Dependent Parameter Modulation:** Use the astrocyte activation state variable to dynamically modulate neuronal or synaptic parameters, representing the effect of gliotransmitter release.
    *   **Neuronal Excitability:** Change $V_{rest}$, $V_{thresh}$, add a slow current $I_{gliotrans}$, or modify adaptation parameters ($a$, $b$ in AdEx/Izhikevich).
    ```python
    # Conceptual: Gliotransmission adds a slow current I_gt to neuron
    # I_gt_max = 5*pA; astro_act_scale = 1.0 # Scale from Astro_act proxy
    # eqs = '''... + I_gt ...
    #          I_gt = I_gt_max * clip(Astro_act - astro_act_threshold, 0, 1) * astro_act_scale : amp
    #          ... (Astro_act dynamics) ...'''
    ```
    *   **Synaptic Strength:** Modify synaptic weights `w` multiplicatively or additively.
    ```python
    # Conceptual: Gliotransmission modulates weight w via network_operation
    # w_base = ... # Store original weights
    # mod_factor = 1.2 # Potentiation factor
    # @network_operation(dt=...)
    # def modulate_weights():
    #    # Get Astro_act for presynaptic neurons (if local) or globally
    #    active_astro_indices = np.where(neurons.Astro_act > astro_act_threshold)[0]
    #    # Identify synapses originating from these neurons
    #    # Apply modulation: syn.w[...] = w_base[...] * mod_factor
    #    # Reset non-modulated weights: syn.w[...] = w_base[...]
    ```
    *   **Plasticity Rules:** Modify parameters of STDP rules (learning rate $A_{pre/post}$, time constants $\tau_{pre/post}$) or gate plasticity entirely based on astrocyte state (e.g., allow LTP only if `Astro_act` is high, conceptually representing D-serine release gating NMDARs).
    ```python
    # Conceptual: Gating STDP LTP term (A_pre) by astrocyte state
    # In STDP on_post rule:
    # on_post = '''apost += A_post
    #              LTP_amount = apre * (1 + LTP_gate_boost * clip(Astro_act_post - threshold, 0, 1))
    #              w = clip(w + LTP_amount, 0, w_max)'''
    # Assumes Astro_act_post is accessible (astro state of postsynaptic neuron)
    ```

These conceptual modeling strategies, while abstracting the underlying biology, enable simulations to explore hypotheses about how activity-dependent astrocyte signaling could provide crucial feedback loops, dynamically regulate synaptic efficacy and plasticity, and influence information processing and learning in networks like those found in brain organoids. The specific parameters controlling the sensitivity, magnitude, and timescale of these simulated glial effects become key factors shaping network behavior.

**12.5 Modeling Oligodendrocytes (Conceptual & Effective Code)**

**Oligodendrocytes** are the myelinating glial cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS), functionally equivalent to Schwann cells in the PNS. Their primary, defining function is the production of **myelin**, a lipid-rich insulating sheath that wraps tightly around neuronal axons. This myelination process is not uniform; it occurs along discrete segments of the axon (**internodes**), leaving short gaps called **Nodes of Ranvier** exposed. This unique structure dramatically alters the mode of action potential propagation.

In unmyelinated axons, the action potential propagates continuously along the axon membrane. This requires voltage-gated ion channels ($Na^+$ and $K^+$) to be distributed along the entire axonal length, and the propagation relies on local circuit currents flowing between adjacent depolarized and resting membrane patches. This process is relatively slow (conduction velocities typically < 2 m/s) and metabolically expensive because ions flow across the membrane along the entire axon, requiring significant energy expenditure by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump to restore gradients.

Myelination fundamentally changes this. The myelin sheath acts as an excellent electrical insulator, greatly increasing the membrane resistance ($R_m$) and decreasing the membrane capacitance ($C_m$) of the internodal segments. This insulation prevents significant ion flow across the internodal membrane. Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels (and associated $K^+$ channels) become highly concentrated almost exclusively at the Nodes of Ranvier. As a result, the action potential cannot propagate continuously along the myelinated segments. Instead, the depolarization generated at one node rapidly spreads passively (electrotonically) along the well-insulated internodal segment to the next node. This rapid passive current flow depolarizes the next node to threshold, triggering the regeneration of the action potential only at that node. The action potential thus appears to "jump" from node to node, a process termed **saltatory conduction**.

The functional consequences of myelination via oligodendrocytes are profound:
1.  **Massively Increased Conduction Velocity:** Saltatory conduction is significantly faster than continuous conduction. Conduction velocities in myelinated axons can reach 100-150 m/s, compared to < 2 m/s in unmyelinated axons of similar diameter. This speed is essential for coordinating activity across large distances in the brain, enabling rapid reflexes, precise temporal processing, and efficient communication within large-scale networks.
2.  **Reduced Metabolic Cost:** By restricting the energy-consuming process of ion flux and pumping primarily to the small nodal regions, myelination dramatically reduces the overall metabolic cost of action potential propagation, allowing for sustained high-frequency activity.
3.  **Axonal Support and Integrity:** Oligodendrocytes also provide vital metabolic support (e.g., supplying lactate via MCT transporters) directly to the axons they ensheath, crucial for maintaining long-term axonal health (He et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023).
4.  **Potential for Plasticity:** Myelination is not static; it can be modulated by neuronal activity, particularly during development but also in adulthood (adaptive myelination), potentially providing another mechanism for circuit refinement and learning by adjusting conduction delays.

Brain organoids often show limited and potentially dysmyelination compared to the *in vivo* brain, although oligodendrocyte precursors are present and myelination can occur over long culture periods or with specific protocols (He et al., 2022). The degree and pattern of myelination can therefore significantly influence the functional dynamics emerging in organoid networks, particularly regarding the speed and synchrony of long-range interactions.

**Modeling Myelination Effects:** Directly simulating saltatory conduction requires highly detailed multi-compartment axonal models explicitly representing nodes and internodes with their distinct electrical properties and channel distributions (Section 11.7). This is computationally prohibitive for network simulations. Therefore, in point-neuron simulations using Brian2, the primary effect of myelination—altered conduction velocity—is typically modeled by adjusting **synaptic transmission delays**.

**Effective Brian2 Code Example:** We can demonstrate the impact of differential delays representing myelination by simulating two parallel pathways transmitting a signal to a target neuron.

```python

```
*Explanation:* This code simulates a single input neuron sending a spike at 10ms to a target neuron via two parallel pathways. `syn_myelinated` has a short delay (2ms), representing a fast, myelinated axon. `syn_unmyelinated` has a longer delay (10ms), representing a slow, unmyelinated axon. The plot of the target neuron's voltage clearly shows two distinct EPSPs arriving at different times (12ms and 20ms) due to these different delays. This demonstrates how explicitly setting different `delay` values in Brian2 `Synapses` objects can effectively model the primary consequence of myelination (altered conduction velocity) and its impact on signal timing within a network simulation. Incorporating distance-dependent delays modulated by a myelination factor (as conceptualized in 12.5) would provide a more sophisticated spatial representation.

**12.6 Modeling Microglia (Conceptual & Effective Code)**

**Microglia** are the specialized resident immune cells of the CNS, originating from myeloid precursors that invade the brain during early development. They constitute about 5-15% of all brain cells and act as the first line of defense, constantly surveying their microenvironment with highly motile processes (Nimmerjahn & Bergles, 2023). Microglia exist in various activation states, transitioning from a "resting" (ramified, surveying) state to different "activated" phenotypes in response to environmental cues like infection, injury, inflammation signals, or changes in neuronal activity. Their functions are diverse and context-dependent, playing crucial roles in development, homeostasis, plasticity, and disease (Galloway et al., 2022).

Key functions relevant to neural computation and network modeling include:
1.  **Synaptic Pruning:** Microglia actively engulf and eliminate synapses, particularly during postnatal development, contributing significantly to the refinement of neural circuits by removing less active or inappropriate connections. This process involves complex signaling between neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, often utilizing molecules like complement factors (C1q, C3) to "tag" synapses for removal (Wilton et al., 2022). Microglial pruning can also occur in the adult brain, potentially contributing to learning-related structural plasticity or pathological synapse loss in diseases like Alzheimer's.
2.  **Neuroinflammation:** Upon detecting "danger" signals (pathogen-associated molecular patterns - PAMPs, or damage-associated molecular patterns - DAMPs released from injured cells), microglia rapidly activate. This activation involves morphological changes (retraction of processes, becoming amoeboid), proliferation, migration towards the site of insult, and the release of a plethora of signaling molecules. These include **pro-inflammatory cytokines** (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), chemokines (attracting other immune cells), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO), which contribute to fighting infection and clearing debris but can also cause bystander damage to neurons if excessive or chronic. Microglia also release **anti-inflammatory cytokines** (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β) and growth factors to resolve inflammation and promote repair (Quintana, 2023).
3.  **Direct Modulation of Neuronal/Synaptic Function:** The factors released by activated microglia, particularly cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1β, can directly bind to receptors on neurons and astrocytes, acutely altering neuronal excitability (e.g., by modulating ion channel expression or function), synaptic transmission (e.g., by increasing glutamate release or affecting AMPA receptor trafficking), and synaptic plasticity (often impairing LTP) (Badimon et al., 2020;ULATION_NEEDED). These effects contribute significantly to the changes in brain function and behavior observed during sickness or chronic inflammatory conditions.

Brain organoids contain microglia-like cells, and studies are exploring their development, activation, and interactions within the organoid context. Understanding their roles is likely important for accurately modeling organoid development and potential responses to inflammatory challenges.

**Modeling Microglial Effects:** Modeling the full repertoire of microglial behavior (sensing, migration, phagocytosis, complex signaling) is extremely challenging and typically requires specialized agent-based modeling approaches. Within Brian2's neuron-centric framework, we must again resort to highly simplified, **conceptual models** focusing on the *functional consequences* of microglial actions on neurons and synapses.

1.  **Synaptic Pruning (Conceptual / Post-Hoc Analysis):** Simulating dynamic synapse removal *during* a standard Brian2 run is complex due to the need to modify network structure.
    *   **Post-Hoc Pruning:** One approach is to run a simulation with activity-dependent synaptic plasticity (e.g., STDP). After the simulation, analyze synaptic weights and activity levels. Based on predefined criteria (e.g., weight below threshold, low correlated activity), identify synapses to be "pruned" and remove them *before* running a subsequent simulation or analysis. A conceptual "microglia activity level" parameter could influence the pruning threshold or rate in this post-hoc step.
    ```python
    # Conceptual Post-Hoc Pruning Logic (Outside Brian2 run)
    # Assume 'synapses' is a Brian2 Synapses object after simulation
    # weight_threshold = 0.1 * nS # Example threshold for pruning
    # low_weight_indices = np.where(synapses.w < weight_threshold)[0]
    # print(f"Identifying {len(low_weight_indices)} synapses for conceptual pruning.")
    # # For next simulation, one could potentially modify the connectivity
    # # based on these indices, though this is complex to manage.
    ```
    *   **Dynamic Weight Decay (Proxy):** A very indirect proxy could be to add a dynamic process where synapse weights decay towards zero unless potentiated by activity, with the decay rate potentially modulated by a conceptual microglial factor. This doesn't remove synapses but weakens them based on inactivity.

2.  **Modulation by Inflammatory Factors (Effective Code Example):** We can simulate the effect of neuroinflammation (conceptually mediated by microglia) by dynamically altering neuronal excitability parameters based on a simulated "inflammation level."

*Explanation:* This runnable example simulates the effect of neuroinflammation by dynamically changing the neurons' firing threshold (`V_thresh`). The `inflammation_level` is controlled externally via a `TimedArray` (simulating a slow change, perhaps triggered by an event not modeled here). A `@network_operation` reads this level and updates `V_thresh` for all neurons (`V_thresh = V_thresh_base + V_thresh_inflamm_max_shift * current_infl_level`). As the inflammation level rises, the threshold increases, making neurons less excitable. The plots show the imposed inflammation level, the resulting change in threshold for one neuron, and the corresponding suppression of network firing rate, demonstrating how glial-mediated inflammation can conceptually dampen network activity.

These examples illustrate how, despite the complexity, the *functional consequences* of glial actions can be incorporated conceptually into Brian2 simulations, primarily through activity-dependent modulation of existing neuronal and synaptic parameters or delays.

**12.7 Challenges and Simplifications in Glial Modeling**

*(Content largely identical to the previous expanded version, reinforcing the difficulties and the nature of the simplifications.)*

Incorporating glial cells realistically into computational models of neural networks presents numerous significant challenges, forcing modelers to adopt various simplifications, especially when using neuron-centric simulation platforms like Brian2.

1.  **Diverse and Complex Biology:** Glia are not monolithic. Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, NG2 cells each have distinct molecular machinery, signaling pathways, metabolic roles, and morphological dynamics, much of which is still being actively researched. Capturing this diversity and complexity accurately in quantitative models is a major hurdle.
2.  **Different Timescales:** Glial processes span a vast range of timescales. Ion/neurotransmitter buffering occurs on milliseconds to seconds. Astrocyte calcium signaling and gliotransmission operate on hundreds of milliseconds to minutes. Inflammatory responses and structural changes (myelination, pruning) unfold over hours, days, or even longer. Efficiently simulating these slow processes concurrently with fast neuronal spiking within a single simulation framework is technically demanding, often requiring multi-rate integration methods or separation of timescales.
3.  **Spatial Complexity:** Glial function is intrinsically linked to 3D space. Astrocytes tile the brain parenchyma, forming distinct domains and interacting with specific synaptic populations via fine processes. Microglia actively migrate through tissue. Oligodendrocytes myelinate specific axonal segments. Astrocyte calcium waves propagate through the syncytium. Accurately capturing these spatial aspects requires spatially explicit modeling frameworks (e.g., reaction-diffusion systems for ECS dynamics, agent-based models for microglia, multi-compartment models for detailed astrocyte/neuron morphology) that go far beyond typical point-neuron network simulators.
4.  **Lack of Quantitative Models & Parameters:** While qualitative understanding of glial functions has exploded, robust, validated, quantitative mathematical models for many glial processes (especially intracellular signaling, gliotransmitter release kinetics, detailed inflammatory cascades, pruning mechanisms) are often less developed compared to neuronal models. Furthermore, experimentally measuring the necessary parameters for such models (e.g., transporter rates, channel kinetics, release probabilities, diffusion constants *in situ*) is extremely challenging.
5.  **Integration with Neuron Simulators:** Standard SNN simulators like Brian2 are highly optimized for efficiently solving large systems of ODEs representing point neurons and their synaptic interactions. Integrating fundamentally different mathematical descriptions needed for realistic glial modeling (e.g., PDEs for diffusion, stochastic rules for agent-based models, complex biochemical reaction networks) directly into these simulators is often difficult, requiring custom extensions, potentially sacrificing performance, or necessitating co-simulation approaches where different simulators handle different aspects of the system and exchange information periodically (Carlu et al., 2022).

Given these formidable challenges, most current efforts to include glial effects within large-scale neuronal network simulations, particularly using tools like Brian2, rely heavily on **simplification and abstraction**:
*   **Focus on Functional Effects:** The primary strategy is to model the *net consequence* of glial activity on neurons or synapses, rather than simulating the glial cell itself in detail. For example, model the *result* of K+ buffering (changes in EK) rather than the astrocyte channels and pumps.
*   **Conceptual State Variables:** Use abstract variables (`astrocyte_activation`, `inflammation_level`, `myelination_factor`) to represent the average or local state of glial populations, governed by simplified dynamics linked to neuronal activity or external inputs.
*   **Parameter Modulation:** Implement glial influence primarily by making existing neuronal or synaptic parameters dynamic, controlled by these conceptual glial state variables (e.g., modulating thresholds, time constants, weights, delays, plasticity rules).
*   **Mean-Field / Population Averaging:** Model the collective effect of a glial population on the average properties of a neuronal population, ignoring heterogeneity and precise spatial locations.
*   **Timescale Separation / Quasi-Steady-State:** Assume slow glial processes reach a quasi-steady state relative to fast neuronal dynamics, or update glial effects only periodically using approaches like `@network_operation`.
*   **Ignoring Spatial Detail:** Treat glial effects as spatially uniform within a population or region, neglecting fine-grained spatial variations.

While these simplifications are often necessary for tractability, they mean that such models are phenomenological representations of neuron-glia *interactions* rather than high-fidelity simulations of glial cells themselves. It is crucial for modelers and interpreters of these simulations to remain acutely aware of the assumptions and limitations inherent in these simplified approaches. Nonetheless, they represent valuable and necessary first steps towards incorporating the crucial contributions of glia into our understanding of neural network function and computation.

**12.8 Brian2 Implementation: Simulating Glial Modulation (Simplified & Conceptual)**

*(This section summarizes the effective code examples provided in 12.2, 12.3, 12.5, and 12.6, emphasizing their conceptual nature.)*

The preceding sections provided runnable Brian2 code examples illustrating how the functional *effects* of different glial cell types might be conceptually simulated within a neuronal network model. These examples focused on modulating neuronal or synaptic parameters based on proxies for glial activity or state:

1.  **Astrocyte K+ Buffering (`12.1_AstrocyteKbufferingSim.ipynb` - Conceptual):** Demonstrated making the neuronal potassium reversal potential ($E_K$) dynamically dependent on recent network activity (estimated via `PopulationRateMonitor` or a per-neuron filtered spike rate), mimicking the effect of $K^+$ accumulation and astrocyte buffering efficiency (represented by the time constant of $E_K$ relaxation).
2.  **Astrocyte Gliotransmission (`12.2_AstrocyteGliotransmissionSim.ipynb` - Conceptual):** Showed how high network firing rates could trigger a temporary, rule-based modulation of synaptic weights (`w`), conceptually representing the release of gliotransmitters by activated astrocytes potentiating synaptic efficacy.
3.  **Oligodendrocyte Myelination (`12.3_OligoMyelinationEffectSim.ipynb` - Effective):** Directly implemented the primary consequence of myelination by assigning significantly different fixed synaptic `delay` values to parallel pathways, demonstrating the impact on signal arrival times at a target neuron.
4.  **Microglia Inflammation Effect (`12.4_MicrogliaInflammationEffectSim.ipynb` - Effective):** Simulated the impact of neuroinflammation by dynamically modulating the neuronal firing threshold (`V_thresh`) based on an externally controlled `inflammation_level` variable (using a `TimedArray` and `@network_operation`), showing how inflammation can alter network excitability.

These examples showcase strategies for incorporating the *influence* of glia using Brian2's core features (dynamic state variables, parameter modulation, `network_operation`, differential delays). They are, however, **highly simplified** and abstract away the complex underlying glial biology. They serve as starting points for exploring the potential impact of neuron-glia interactions rather than as detailed glial simulations themselves. Building more realistic integrated models remains an active area of research, often requiring specialized tools or significant custom development.

**12.9 Conclusion and Planned Code**

This chapter significantly broadened our modeling perspective by incorporating the vital contributions of **glial cells**—the often-underestimated partners of neurons. We moved decisively beyond a purely neuron-centric view, detailing the critical reasons why accounting for glial functions is essential for understanding brain computation, development, and disease. We elaborated on the multifaceted roles of **astrocytes** in maintaining ionic and neurotransmitter homeostasis (K+ buffering, glutamate uptake), actively modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity via gliotransmission at the tripartite synapse; the crucial impact of **oligodendrocytes** on signal propagation speed through myelination; and the dynamic functions of **microglia** in synaptic pruning and orchestrating neuroinflammatory responses. Throughout, we emphasized the profound **challenges** associated with realistically modeling these complex glial processes, particularly their slower timescales, spatial characteristics, intricate biochemistry, and integration with standard neuronal simulators. This led us to focus on **conceptual modeling strategies** achievable within Brian2, emphasizing the simulation of the **functional consequences** of glial activity on neuronal and synaptic parameters. We provided expanded discussion and more concrete **Brian2 code examples** demonstrating how effects like activity-dependent $K^+$ buffering, gliotransmitter-mediated synaptic modulation, differential myelination delays, and inflammation-induced excitability changes might be implemented, albeit in a simplified, phenomenological manner. While acknowledging the inherent limitations, incorporating even these simplified glial influences represents a crucial step towards building more biologically faithful and potentially computationally richer models of neural systems like brain organoids, where neuron-glia interactions are integral to emergent structure and function.
